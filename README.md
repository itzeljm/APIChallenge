CODE2040 API CHALLENGE REFLECTION 
========================

As I began this challenge I was a little afraid that I was not going to be able 
to complete it due to my lack of experience.
Compare to most, I am fairly new to the world of Computer Science as it was not until 
my freshman year of college that I learned about it and when my passion for this field
developed. But despite obstacles like these I always try my hardest to complete any
challenge that is presented to me. 

I have felt like this challenge has taught me a lot, not only about connecting and 
retrieving information from an API's but also about myself and the way I think. I had never
worked with an API before, I didn't really know what an API was until this challenge and so 
that is how I began this challenge by learning whan an API was. Personally, this challenge was difficult and lengthy but it was a very rewarding experience. 

These are just some of the lessons I learned throughout the challenge. I learned that it is
not easy to learn things on your own but is often the best way to learn. Another thing that
I have learned is how important attention to detail is. I spent hours, more like days,
trying to figure out why my registration wasn't going through to the server. It was very
frustrating but I finally found what I was doing wrong. The cause of my error turned out to
be a very small but very important part of the registration phase. The reason
was that I had put the string "Email" inside my JSON dictionary instead of "email", which
was the correct string to put, and "Github" instead of "github", and because of this small
mistake I spent hours trying to register my code to the API. I know this is very silly of me
and it was frustrating too, but because of this mistake I have now learned a very very
valuable lesson which is to go back to the spec whenever you are working on a project and
that attention to detail is of critical importance. 

I have also learned a lot about how classes work within a package and feel like I finally
understand why the material we learn in my Computer Science courses are so important. 

This challenge has helped me grow a lot as a Computer Scientist and has motivated me to
continue working on projects of my own, which I am super excited to start. 
This is a small summary of my code2040 API Challenge experience.
