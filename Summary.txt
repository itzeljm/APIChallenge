CODE2040 API CHALLENGE REFLECTION 

Author : Itzel Martinez
========================

As I began this challenge I was a little afraid that I was not going to be able 
to complete it due to my lack of experience.
Compare to most, I am fairly new to the world of computer science. 
It was not until my freshman year of college that I learned about Computer Science 
and it was that same year that my passion for this field developed. 

This challenge has taught me a lot, not only about connecting and retrieving information 
from an API's but also about myself and the way I think. I had never worked with an API
before, I didn't really know what an API was until this challenge. For me this challenge was
a long, hard and very rewarding experience. 

I learned that it is not easy to learn things on your own but is often the best way to learn.
Another thing that I have learned is how important paying attention to detail is. I spent 
hours trying to figure out why my registration wasn't going through to the server. It turned
out to be a very small but very important mistake that was the cause of my error. The reason
was that I had put the string "Email" inside my JSON dictionary instead of "email", which
was the correct string to put, and "Github" instead of "github", and because of this small
mistake I spent hours trying to register my code to the API. I know this is very silly of me
and it was frustrating too, but because of this mistake I have now learned a very very
valuable lesson which is to go back to the spec whenever you are working on a project and
that attention to detail is of critical importance. 

I have also learned a lot about how classes work within a package and feel like I finally
understand why the material we learn in my Computer Science classes are so important. 

This challenge has helped me grow a lot as a Computer Scientist and has motivated me to
continue working on projects of my own, which I am super excited to start. This is a small
summary of my code2040 API Challenge experience.
